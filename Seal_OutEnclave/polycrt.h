    /**
    Provides functionality for encrypting several plaintext numbers into one ciphertext
    for improved memory efficiency and efficient vector operations (SIMD). Multiplying and 
    adding such ciphertexts together performs the respective operation on each of the slots 
    independently and simultaneously. This functionality is often called "batching" in
    homomorphic encryption literature.

    @par Mathematical Background
    Mathematically speaking, if poly_modulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and plain_modulus 
    is a prime number t such that 2N divides t-1, then integers modulo t contain a primitive 
    2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct linear factors as 
    X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod t, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n are all the distinct 
    primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo t. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) 
    states that the plaintext space Z_t[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is isomorphic (as an algebra) 
    to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_t. The isomorphism is easy to compute explicitly 
    in both directions, which is what an instance of this class can be used for.

    @par Valid Parameters
    Whether batching can be used depends strongly on the encryption parameters. Thus, to
    construct a PolyCRTBuilder the user must provide an instance of EncryptionParameters
    such that the EncryptionParameterQualifiers object returned by the function 
    EncryptionParameters::GetQualifiers() has the flags parameters_set and enable_batching
    set to true.

    @see EncryptionParameters for more information about encryption parameters.
    @see EncryptionParameterQualifiers for more information about encryption parameters that support batching.
