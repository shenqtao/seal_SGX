    /**
    Represents the user-customizable encryption scheme settings. Several settings (e.g., poly_modulus(), coeff_modulus(),
    plain_modulus()) significantly affect the performance, capabilities, and security of the encryption scheme. KeyGenerator,
    Encryptor, Decryptor, Evaluator, and other objects in the library all require the EncryptionParameters object to specify
    and agree on the encryption scheme settings.

    Picking appropriate encryption parameters is essential to enable a particular application while balancing performance and
    security. Some encryption settings will not allow some inputs (e.g., attempting to encrypt a polynomial with more
    coefficients than poly_modulus() or larger coefficients than plain_modulus()) or support some computations (with noise
    growing too fast as determined by coeff_modulus() and decomposition_bit_count()). The ChooserPoly and ChooserEvaluator
    classes provide functionality to help determine the best encryption parameters for an application. Additionally, please 
    refer to external documentation to determine the best parameters.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from EncryptionParameters is thread-safe while mutating is not. Refer to the thread-safety of
    individual parameter types to assess their thread-safety.

    @warning Choosing inappropriate EncryptionParameters may load to an encryption scheme that is not secure, does not perform
    well, and/or does not support the input and computation of the application.
