    /**
    Models the inherent noise in a ciphertext based on given EncryptionParameters object.
    When performing arithmetic operations on encrypted data, the quality of the ciphertexts will degrade,
    i.e. the inherent noise in them will grow, until at a certain point decryption will fail to work.
    The Simulation object together with SimulationEvaluator can help the user understand how inherent
    noise grows in different homomorphic operations, and to adjust the encryption parameters accordingly.
    
    Instances of Simulation can be manipulated using SimulationEvaluator, which has a public API similar to Evaluator,
    making existing code easy to run on simulations instead of running it on actual encrypted data. In other words,
    using SimulationEvaluator, simulations can be added, multiplied, subtracted, negated, etc., and the result is always
    a new Simulation object whose inherent noise is obtained using average-case analysis of the noise behavior in the 
    encryption scheme.

    @par Inherent Noise
    Technically speaking, the inherent noise of a ciphertext is a polynomial, but the condition for decryption working
    depends on the size of the largest absolute value of its coefficients. It is really the size of this
    largest absolute value that Simulation is simulating, and that we will call the "noise", the "inherent noise",
    or the "error", in this documentation. The reader is referred to the description of the encryption scheme for more details.
